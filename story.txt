Once upon a time there was miserly old woman whose only friends were the mice who lived in her cupboards.
The mice's name was Janet and she was 2 years old. Janet lost her tail in the fight.

That fight, THE fight, is where our story begins and reveals why a woman would become so miserly and choose to have only mice as her companions.

It all started on a cold soggy day last October.
A woman named Claire fled a dilapidated house, faintly resembling a shoe, with nothing but a kerchief, ladle, top hat and scraps of cheese.  She began her journey



The end.
