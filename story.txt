Once upon a time there was miserly old woman whose only friends were the mice who lived in her cupboards.
The mice's name was Janet and she was 2 years old. Janet lost her tail in the fight.

That fight, THE fight, is where our story begins and reveals why a woman would become so miserly and choose to have only mice as her companions.

It all started on a cold soggy day last October.

A woman named Claire fled a house, faintly resembling a shoe, with nothing but a kerchief, ladle, top hat and scraps of cheese.  She began her journey to the junkyard with idea to find some nice fancy stuffs for her home and maybe something to eat

Unfortunately, in that junkyard lived a cranky Elephant. His name was Phil. Phil was the keeper of all the fancy stuff and he kept it organized with an army of mice. The mice were paid very little (a grain of rice or crumb per day of work).

The mice were even more miserable than Claire and she knew she had to help these poor little creatures. Whenever Phil's trunk was still with sleep, Claire rallied the mice and fanned the flames of rebellion.

The end.
